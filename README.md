# Project Environment
We decided on setting our Environment variable to RESEARCH_PATH.

The script that creates a new directory can be found here [directory_creator.bat](directory_creator.bat).

# Collaboration Tools:
Slack Group and Apps for Slack were created.

[test-alice-bob](test-alice-bob) contains the Re-do of the toy example of a two-person workflow.

# Writing with LaTeX
The folder [text](text) contains all the Latex exercises.

There are multiple Paper and Presentation that fulfil the exercise requirements, but for easier navigation have a look at [Paper1](text/paper/Paper1.pdf) and [Beamer1](text/presentation/beamer1.pdf)

# Data Management:
Data is located in [data](data).
API scripts are located in [API Exercises](API%20Exercises).

Scripts [connect.py](API%20Exercises/connect.py), [downstream.py](API%20Exercises/downstream.py) and [upstream.py](API%20Exercises/upstream.py) do the API job.

Notebook [Database Routine Example.ipynb](API%20Exercises/Database%20Routine%20Example.ipynb) does a step by step use of the scripts.

# Web API
Notebook [API_Binance.ipynb](API%20Exercises/API_Binance.ipynb) has the answers to the Binance API exercise. 

The code produces either a csv or feather file in the %RESEARCH_PATH%/data directory.

Markdown file [API_FRED](API%20Exercises/API_FRED.md) has the answers to the FRED API exercise.
